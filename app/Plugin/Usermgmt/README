5. Enable Plugin in your bootstrap.php

        yourapp/app/Config/bootstrap.php should include this line

        // load Usermgmt plugin and apply plugin routes. Keep all the other plugins you are using here
        CakePlugin::loadAll(array(
            'Usermgmt' => array('routes' => true, 'bootstrap' => true),
        ));

6. Add plugin css in your layout file
    for example yourapp/app/View/Layouts/default.ctp
    echo $this->Html->css('/usermgmt/css/umstyle.css?q='.QRDN);
    
    Please note: I have removed cake.generic.css from umstyle.css in 1.1 version, Now it's your wish you can use cake.generic.css separatly. If you want to use cake.generic.css then you should load it before plugin css.
    In 1.2 version I have added cache control query string in css and js files include syntax. For more information see documentation.
